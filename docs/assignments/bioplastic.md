# 1. Biofabricating materials


## Research and inspiration

Looking close to home, I believe one of the first times I was introduced to using biomaterials as a source was when [Kristel Peters](http://shoedesigner.be/about-me/) presented her work during a lecture at the [Ghent Design Museum](https://www.designmuseumgent.be/).

Kristal is a shoe designer who focuses on sustainability. She uses circular economy models and looks for new materials with a low to no impact.

She grows shoes using mycelium. Don‚Äôt they look amazing?

But there‚Äôs also Alice. ‚ÄúAlice is a statement against and a potential solution for this immense waste created by fast fashion. In Upper 7, Alice wears an upper-coat made out of barkcloth. BARK CLOTH¬Æ **is the bast that comes from the Mutuba fig tree. The material or the cloth is manufactured from one single tree which produces a new annual bark and there is not added of additives ‚Äì can, of course, this perfect product can be composted after use without leaving the only harmful substances.‚Äù

Wow!

Be sure to check her work!

Another artist who I think does amazing work with biomaterials, is [Charlotte Gautier van Tour](https://charlottegautiervantour.fr/).
Amongst other things, she makes big installations all over the world and allows the biomaterials to set in the space. They change over time while drying.
This works is called [Top View](https://charlottegautiervantour.fr/Top-View). I love it!

[Land of water](https://charlottegautiervantour.fr/Lands-of-Water) is based on a map of The Netherlands. Can you tell?
It‚Äôs a beautiful work of art, based on agar agar and spiruline. I cannot stop looking at it üôÇ
