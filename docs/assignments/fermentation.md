# Fermentation 

Fermentation has been utilised by humans for thousands of years in the production of food and beverages. It not only preserves food but also enhances flavours and textures. Additionally, fermentation plays a crucial role in various biological processes, such as the production of certain vitamins and antibiotics.

I’ve been fermenting tomatoes and cucumbers for a long time as it’s a good way to preserve all the goodies my garden gives me during summer. Nothing beats fresh vegetables!



**Lacto fermented blueberries**

Lacto fermentation is a special process where you let something sweet (mostly fruit) ferment using salt and a vacuum bag or container.

Three days in and my blueberries are ready for a first tasting test. For me they can ferment a bit longer as the salt-sweet balance isn’t quite right yet. I resealed the package and will re-taste in the next few days.

(…waiting takes time ;-))

Six days in and the berries are nice and red and absolutely delicious!

**Kombucha**

The steps to make kombucha are super easy:


1. Make fresh tea
2. Add 3 spoons of sugar and stir them until they dissolve in the hot tea
3. Let it cool down enough (otherwise you will kill your scoby when adding it!)
4. Add the scooby and starter fluid
5. Put the cheese cloth on top with a rubber band
6. Place in a dark place for two weeks
7. Wait for the magic to happen!

I made two flavours, the left is green tea and the right is coffee.

I’m pretty curious so I took a peak after one week, scoby is coming along nicely!
