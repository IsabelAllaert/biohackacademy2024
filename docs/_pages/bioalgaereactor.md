# Bio Algae reactor


A bio algae reactor is used to cultivate and grow algae for various purposes, such as biofuel production, wastewater treatment, carbon capture, and production of high-value compounds like omega-3 fatty acids or pigments.

The idea is to create a perfect environment for algae to grow. Typically this means including sufficient light, nutrients and carbon dioxide. Algae us light energy to photosyntesise carbon dioxide and nutrients into biomass. Oxygen is released as a byproduct.

There are lotâ€™s of different types of bio algae reactors around, but letâ€™s stick to the small one ðŸ™‚ 

**What are algae?**

Algae are a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms that range from single-celled microscopic organisms to multicellular seaweeds. They are found in various aquatic environments such as freshwater, marine habitats, and even in damp terrestrial environments like soil, rocks, and trees. Algae play crucial roles in ecosystems and have significant economic and ecological importance.

******Nodularia harveyana**

Nodularia harveyana is a brown alga found in temperate coastal waters, particularly along the southern coast of Australia and New Zealand, forming dense tufts of branched fronds attached to substrates. As a member of the family Cystoseiraceae, it plays crucial ecological roles, providing habitat for marine organisms, contributing to primary production, and serving as an indicator of environmental health. While not considered endangered, conservation efforts are vital to mitigate threats such as habitat degradation, pollution, and climate change, ensuring the continued health of coastal ecosystems where it thrives.

**Odontella aurita**

Odontella aurita is a species of diatom, a type of micro algae found in marine and brackish waters worldwide, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterised by its distinctive chain-forming structure and golden-brown coloration. Odontella aurita plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems as a primary producer, contributing significantly to global carbon fixation and serving as a food source for various marine organisms. Additionally, it is of interest to researchers due to its ability to produce bioactive compounds with potential applications in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and nutrition.

**Medium**

Both species may also be influenced by factors such as water temperature, light availability, nutrient levels (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, silica), and other environmental variables.



## How to build your own reactor

**Materials needed**


1. Transparent container (glass or plastic will do)
2. Air pump or bubbler
3. Tubes
4. Algae culture (you can look online or go to a local aquarium store)
5. Nutrient solution (look online or make one yourself)
6. Light source


**How to build?**


1. **Prepare the Container**: Clean the container thoroughly to remove any residues that may inhibit algae growth. Ensure that it is transparent to allow light penetration.


2. **Set up Aeration**: Attach the airline tubing to the air pump or bubbler. Place the other end of the tubing into the bottom of the container. This will provide aeration for the algae culture by bubbling air through the water.


    I only had one bubbler that fit the bottles I had, so I 3D-printed an extra one. You can find it on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4719595).

3. **Prepare Nutrient Solution**: Mix the nutrient solution according to the instructions provided with the commercial nutrient product or prepare a homemade solution using fertiliser. Be sure not to overdose on nutrients, as excessive nutrient levels can promote the growth of undesirable algae species.


4. **Inoculate with Algae**: Add the algae culture or starter culture to the container. Start with a small amount, as algae will multiply rapidly under favourable conditions.


5. **Add Nutrient Solution**: Pour the prepared nutrient solution into the container. Ensure that the algae culture is adequately submerged and mixed with the nutrient solution.


6. **Provide Light**: Place the container in a location where it will receive adequate light. If using artificial light, position the light source above the container. If using sunlight, place the container near a window or outdoors (if weather permits).


7. **Monitor and Maintain**: Monitor the algae culture regularly for growth and overall health. Adjust aeration, nutrient levels, and light exposure as needed to promote optimal growth conditions. Be mindful of temperature fluctuations, as extreme temperatures can affect algae growth.


8. **Harvest and Renew**: Depending on your intended use, you can harvest algae biomass periodically for further processing or experimentation. You can also use a portion of the culture to inoculate a new batch to maintain a continuous culture.


**Watch them grow!** I have two Chinese volunteers supervising the farm ðŸ™‚
