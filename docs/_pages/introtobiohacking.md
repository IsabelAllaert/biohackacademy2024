# Intro to biohacking

So, BioHack academy? Sounds rather tricky and scary, no? 
Don’t be too worried, a lot of safety guidelines are in place to make sure we don’t end up cultivating a flesh eating bacteria or try to grow a dinosaur like Dr. Wu.

But what is biohacking about? A little online search reveals there a quite a few aspects to biohacking ranging from optimising diets to implanted RFID-tags and even gene editing.

It isn’t new either, we’ve been biohacking for a long time. Think about drug trails, or even further back to early 20th Century when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin which revolutionised modern medicine. Or Jonas Salk, who developed the polio vaccine in the 50’s.

In the late 60’s the punk movement launched a new era of DIY-making. [The Whole Earth catalog](https://monoskop.org/images/0/09/Brand_Stewart_Whole_Earth_Catalog_Fall_1968.pdf) is referred to as one of the first guides to biohacking and DIY-making in modern living. It was based on the insights of Buckminster Fuller. If you haven’t heard of him, do look him up. 

Fuller believed that the modern world has an abundance of know-how that, if we choose to use it, would eliminate scarcity and depletion of resources by the intelligent application of design. He believed that because of this, there would be no more war and we would enter an era of peace and intelligent stewardship.

Of course biohacking has evolved quickly since the computer was invented. By now we have access to low-cost biotech tools which allows us to experiment away. Community biohacking spaces, such as the open wetlab at waag, make sure that amateur scientists can experiment in a safe way.

One could state that biohacking reflects a combination of scientific progress, technological innovation, cultural shifts, and curiosity. Together they converge to empower makers and DIY-scientists to explore and experiment with their own biology.

The range of possibilities is endless, but that’s rather exciting for me. But when a lot can be done, it is absolutely crucial that we keep in mind the ethical, legal and safety concerns.

WAAG has a ‘Standard operating procedures for the waag wetlab’-guide which informs us about the safety protocols we have to keep in mind while working in the lab.
If you work in a local lab, they will inform you about their own guidelines. Follow them to make you sure you don’t end up taking a pathogene home that could kill your pet. (I know, a bit drastic, but at least I have your attention ;-).)

So.. Let’s dive into this real life sci-fi movie and tinker away in the brave new world of biohacking!

(And I would really like that dinosaur…)
