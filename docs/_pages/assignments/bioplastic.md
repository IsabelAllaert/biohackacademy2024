# Bioplastics

## Research and inspiration

Looking close to home, I believe one of the first times I was introduced to using biomaterials as a source was when \[Kristel Peters\](http://shoedesigner.be/about-me/) presented her work during a lecture at the \[Ghent Design Museum\](https://www.designmuseumgent.be/).

Kristal is a shoe designer who focuses on sustainability. She uses circular economy models and looks for new materials with a low to no impact.

She grows shoes using mycelium. Don‚Äôt they look amazing?

But there‚Äôs also Alice. ‚ÄúAlice is a statement against and a potential solution for this immense waste created by fast fashion. In Upper 7, Alice wears an upper-coat made out of barkcloth. BARK CLOTH¬Æ **is the bast that comes from the Mutuba fig tree. The material or the cloth is manufactured from one single tree which produces a new annual bark and there is not added of additives ‚Äì can, of course, this perfect product can be composted after use without leaving the only harmful substances.‚Äù

Wow!

Be sure to check her work!

Another artist who I think does amazing work with biomaterials, is \[Charlotte Gautier van Tour\](https://charlottegautiervantour.fr/).
Amongst other things, she makes big installations all over the world and allows the biomaterials to set in the space. They change over time while drying.
This works is called \[Top View\](https://charlottegautiervantour.fr/Top-View). I love it!

\[Land of water\](https://charlottegautiervantour.fr/Lands-of-Water) is based on a map of The Netherlands. Can you tell?
It‚Äôs a beautiful work of art, based on agar agar and spiruline. I cannot stop looking at it üôÇ

## Bioplastics in the mix


Bioplastics are a type of plastic (really!) derived from renewable sources. Think corn starch, agar, microbiota, ‚Ä¶ They are considered sustainable because they break down in about 90 days when the conditions are right. Bioplastics could be a solution for being less dependable on fossil fuels in the future.

To make plastic, you typically need:


- a polymer
- plasticiser

You could add a filler, a pigment, ‚Ä¶ if you wanted to. Adding ingredients will alter the properties of you plastic. It‚Äôs a lot of fun to experiment!

During the fabricademy I made a lot of coffee-based bioplastic as part of my research project to find an alternative for linoleum to make prints with. For the biohack academy I will use another resource of which I have an infinite supply: Mysa her hair.
I will also do a test using active charcoal as I will need a conductive material for my final projects. Let‚Äôs get plastic!

**Plasticise Mysa** 

Mysa is my wonderful four-legged friend. Half husky, half golden retriever.
She‚Äôs super sweet, very stubborn and she loves cookies. As a bonus she has the double fur of a husky, so twice a year she sheds her fur which started last week.


![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_8069AB8A0A5095BEA9F80685DBE6147B06C0A5CCF37D0673C5EE9FADC22587DA_1712561065925_9A20C690-0A46-477D-ADB1-407F21B3FF07_1_105_c.jpeg)


So, time to test how Mysa‚Äôs hair acts as a fibre in bioplastic!

**Plasticise Active charcoal**

Activated charcoal, also known as activated carbon, is a form of carbon that has been processed to have small, low-volume pores that increase its surface area and make it highly adsorbent. This adsorbent property allows activated charcoal to trap chemicals and toxins, making it useful for various applications, particularly in medicine, water purification, and air filtration.

To some extend active charcoal can act as a conductive material when it‚Äôs mixed with the right ingredients. Let‚Äôs see how it does as a bioplastic.


**Preparation is key**

Making bioplastic is really easy.
You need a few things:


- a stove
- a pot
- a spatula / whisk / spoon
- a scale
- your notebook üôÇ 

And of course your ingredients:


- glycerine (now the Bush-song is stuck in my head again)
- water
- agar
- fillers: active charcoal and Mysa-hair


![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_8069AB8A0A5095BEA9F80685DBE6147B06C0A5CCF37D0673C5EE9FADC22587DA_1712561161769_03304521-BFD5-4F93-86C6-DFCEAB397A31_1_105_c.jpeg)


Steps:


- Measure every ingredient beforehand
- Boil the water
- Add the agar and stir until the agar has dissolved
- Add the filler
- Leave it boil until it thickens, stirring your heart out (otherwise it sticks)
- Pour it into a numbered container (I used a glass petri dish to have a smooth surface)
- Leave it to cool down
- Cut around the edges to the bioplastic can shrink (I turn them around every few hours)
- Leave them to dry for a couple of days

**Recipes**

Base recipe:


- 160 ml water
- 22 g glycerine
- 8 g agar

I made 6 different tests


![](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_8069AB8A0A5095BEA9F80685DBE6147B06C0A5CCF37D0673C5EE9FADC22587DA_1712562009972_27803874-098D-4600-98C4-FA4A9AB8F57E_1_201_a.jpeg)


**Results**

By now (4 days later) the bioplastic containing active charcoal shrunk quite a bit! However the bioplastic containing Mysa hair hasn‚Äôt shrunk all that much.

To measure is to know.
I started off by measuring the resistance of the active charcoal plastic using a multimeter.

As far as the bioplastic with dog hair goes: it‚Äôs really flexible! It would seem that Mysa‚Äôs hair is a very good fibre to use. The bioplastic doesn‚Äôt break easily. Thankfully the dog smell has disappeared too ;-)
